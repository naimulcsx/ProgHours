## What is progHours?

progHours is an effort to combine problem-solving and gamification techniques to build a platform that will motivate users to keep improving their skills and compete with each other. It also helps coaches by offering valuable insights through comprehensive analytics to monitor and assess student progress.

## Motivation and Goals

We noticed that motivating students to engage in problem-solving is challenging. To solve this, we took the initiative to develop a platform that integrates gamification techniques, aiming to boost student engagement with problem-solving and foster peer competition within a community.

This project is experimental and we are working to define and refine our goals. However, we have settled on the following common goals for the project:

- To provide comprehensive analytics on your problem-solving journey.

- To use gamification techniques, such as leaderboard, points and rewards, to motivate students to learn and compete with others.

- To provide coaches with valuable insights through comprehensive analytics to monitor and assess student progress.

- To foster a sense of community and shared accomplishment among students.

- To provide students with the opportunity to showcase their profile and skillls to tech recruiters.

## Tech Stack
