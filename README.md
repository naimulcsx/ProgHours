Motivating students to learn and practice competitive programming is a challenge. However, with the right approach and tools, it is possible to engage and motivate students to learn and improve their skills in this area.

Gamification can be a useful tool to make learning and practicing competitive programming more engaging and enjoyable. It can also be a way to motivate people to keep practicing and improving their skills. This is especially important in competitive programming, where the learning curve is steep and there is always more to learn and improve upon.

## Goals
Please note that this project is highly experimental and we are working to define and refine our goals. However, we have settled on the following common goals for the project:

- To provide a fun and engaging platform for students to learn and practice competitive programming.
- To use gamification techniques, such as leaderboard, points and rewards, to motivate students to learn and improve their skills.
- To foster a sense of community and shared accomplishment among students by providing a platform for them to compete with one another and track their progress.
- To help students develop a growth mindset and a love of learning through the use of game-like mechanics.
- To provide students with the opportunity to showcase their profile and skillls to tech recruiters.
